# What is this?
Well, I prepare my exam by searching, reading, understanding and documenting entire board exam papers. When the exams arrive, I share it with my friends. So one day, I thought, "Wait a minute, what if I share these notes to all the people who are studing BCA from Pokhara University? Wouldn't that would be a great idea?". Hence this happened. So, what do you tihnk, isn't this a cool opensource project ;-D
